# UFOs
## Overview of Project:
### Purpose: 
  - Adding more criterias to filters to get desired UFO sightings information. Instead of just date filters, we add city, state, country, and shape.
### Results
  - The webpage has 5 criterias you can search for and the process is easy to follow.
  - Example: If you want to search an UFO sighting on 1/10/2010 and within California state. You can enter this information in the box and hit enter, it will build a table that reflects your seach

  - The table is dynamic so you can search with just 1 or more criterias
 
### Summary
  - Drawback: Since the data table does not follow the alphabet order it might hard for someone to glance at the table at first
  - Recommendations: 
        - We might put a summary table showing the city names, states, countries so people will know which information they want to search.
        - We might also put a search button at the end of the filter search which will make the website more visually appealing.
